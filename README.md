## Overview

A very interesting beginner project indeed, helped me understand and improve my basic skills in front-end designing

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
-  See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My process

I was able to start building this using the mobile first design on my CSS and I made use of SASS and git for practice purposes

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  SASS
-  Mobile-first workflow
-  Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I learned more on using SASS and also improved my use of DOM manipulators in Javascript

### Continued development

I do need to practice more on DOM manipulation and also responsive designs later in future
